# Currency Converter - Java Mini Project
Currencio is a Java mini project created for my college project. The project uses Java programming language and an Exchange Rate API to convert currency rates.

## Project Description
Currency Converter is a simple and user-friendly project that allows users to convert currency rates from one currency to another. The project retrieves live exchange rate data from the Exchange Rate API and uses Java to perform the necessary calculations to convert the currencies.

The project consists of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) developed using Java Swing. The GUI allows users to select the input and output currencies and enter the amount they wish to convert. Once the user clicks the "Convert" button, the project retrieves the latest exchange rates from the API and calculates the converted amount.

## Technologies Used
* Java Programming Language
* Java Swing (GUI toolkit)
* Exchange Rate API
## Installation and Usage
To run the Currency Converter project, follow these steps:
* Clone or download the project repository.
* Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
* Run the "Main.java" file to start the project.
* Enter the amount to convert, select the input and output currencies, and click the "Convert" button.
